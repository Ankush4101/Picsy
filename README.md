This project features an AI tool for generating images from a 2.4 GB dataset with 2.4 million rows using SDXL technology. It uses a scalable Kubernetes setup on GCP, handles image requests efficiently with AWS SQS and Lambda, and improves search speed by 20% with AWS OpenSearch. Ideal for fast and effective image generation and retrieval.
